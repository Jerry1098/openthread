# esp-openthread - WORK IN PROGRESS

This is using the [Rust open source IEEE-802.15.4 driver](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-ieee802154) and [OpenThread](https://openthread.io/) to provide a Thread implementation for ESP32 bare-metal Rust.

The OpenThread libraries are pre-compiled for convenience. Find the build script in `build_openthread`

## Goals

- Provide MTD functionality.

## Maybe later goals

- Provide sleepy end-device support
- Provide FTD functionality

## Non-Goals

- BR functionality

## Status

This is only tested on ESP32-C6. Only very basic functionality is tested.

There are only few Rust-wrapper. Until everything is wrapped you need to use the raw bindings for more advanced functionality.

## Testing

Build and flash the [OT-CLI](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/openthread/ot_cli) on ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2.

Flash the example to an ESP32-C6. It should output something like
```
Initializing
fe80::906d:1cce:1bc9:8d07
ChangedFlags(Ipv6AddressAdded | ThreadRoleChanged | ThreadLlAddressChanged | ThreadMeshLocalAddressChanged | ThreadKeySequenceChanged | ThreadNetworkDataChanged | Ipv6MulticastSubscribed | ThreadPanIdChanged | ThreadNetworkNameChanged | ThreadExtendedPanIdChanged | ThreadNetworkKeyChanged | ThreadNetworkInterfaceStateChanged | ActiveDatasetChanged)
ChangedFlags(ThreadRoleChanged | ThreadRlocAdded | ThreadPartitionIdChanged | ThreadNetworkDataChanged | PendingDatasetChanged)
```

Please note the link-local address.

Back in the OT-CLI ping the device (using the address from above)
```
> ping fe80::906d:1cce:1bc9:8d07

16 bytes from fe80:0:0:0:906d:1cce:1bc9:8d07: icmp_seq=15 hlim=64 time=13ms
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/avg/max = 13/13.0/13 ms.
Done
```

So it connected and you can successfully ping the device ðŸŽ‰
